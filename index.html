<h1>Important Concepts</h1>
<b>How the Web Works</b>
<br>
<br>
A user opens a browser on their computer 
such as Firefox and requests information
<br>from a URL such as <a href=""WWW.Udacity.com.>
Udacity.com.</a>  The set of rules
used to traverse the world wide web
<br> is called <b>HTTP</b> or 
<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>
and the information sought might be a 
<br>webpage containing text, videos, images etc.  
The webpage displayed is 
written in a 
<br>language the computer understands called <b>HTML</b> or <em>Hypertext 
Markup Language.</em>
<br><b>HTTP</b> finds the <b>HTML</b> document on the correct server (another type of computer that 
<br>stores information) and sends it back where the browser 
interprets and displays 
<br>the information on the user's screen.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hypertext Markup 
  language
</b>
<br>
<br>Hypertext Markup Language or <em>HTML</em> for short
is <b>code</b> programmers write in so that 
<br>the computer understands.  The sentence: "I'm <b>learning</b> to code!--
for example--requires 
<br>a special "code" to tell the computer to make the letters in the word "learning" appear 
<br>in bold type.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why Programmers are so Smart</b>
<br>
<br>
Programmers have to be smart because computers are stupid!  Programmers must write
<br> code in the correct syntax because computers translate the code literally; this can be 
<br>frustrating but with extreme focus--powerful.
<br>
<br>
<b>Programmer's Vocabulary</b>
<br>
<br>
Programmers are smarter than computers but they cannot remember all the rules!  If you
<br>forget a rule--just look it up!  There are <b>tags, elements, attributes, inline and block 
<br>element</b> definitions and rules.  In HTML, the <b>text</b> is <em>what you see</em>
and the <b>markup</b> is 
<br><em>what it looks like.</em>  A "b" tag was used in the previous sentence to make the letters in the
<br>word "text" appear bold; it requires a "b" opening tag and a "b" closing tag to create the
<BR> appearance.  The word "text" is called the <b>content</b> and the entire string of information
<br> is called an <b>element.</b>   As mentioned there are <b>attributes, inline and block elements etc.</b>
<br> Look them up!
